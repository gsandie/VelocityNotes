Instrumenting the real time web with node.js - Bryan Cantrill (Joyent)

closures are really important in js

async with unix apis = win

dtrace - important for ass saving - proper win - probably want to go and look at some papers on it

ruby has providers that lets you instrument it, google it

gc matters with node.js

on teh github - bcantrill -- also silentrob

found that cpu was less than 6%, however network, network can get worked really hard with little cpu

in the real time system the main thing that matters is the latency, and espesically in a distributed system the dist of latency osver time is essential, don't avg that out
