Theo - Dashboards for web operations

Dashboard: instrumentation, actionable info, relavent to your purview and purpose

observe and don't influence via teh dashboard

you are there to increase value for teh business and ensure success

how do we measure so we can say "I accomplished this goal" of whatever the business goal is, set by the shareholders/board/ceo (he executes it - the vision)

as stuff changes the metrics for success will change, gotta have the transparency accross the groups

take the metrics from all over the business, marketing, hr, call center, finance, and along with the tech stuff, make a dashboard from that

mttd (mean time to detect) is v.important and usually awful

monitor the buisness, you running that fast website is a direct affect on the business

text is useful, consider deployment (version numbers of the deploy), or http codes, you'd want to see deployment version + AGE of deploy person (and get the previous when that was, and count of deploys), colour is useful and important for these things

[[ or with the http codes I guess you'd count them ]]

numbers are trickier as gauges imply a deep understanding of bounds and tolerances, for things that are fixed and you understand it you can use it e.g, like percentages, temperatures, power per rack, bw per uplink

but gauges shouldn't be used for things like; iops, current visitor counts, requests per second, bw overall; things with no bounds or unknown bounds (changing the ranges are bad!!)

For numbers graphs are better (but remember the problems with the averages of the data from the 'look at your data' talk)

understanding the users, they live everywhere, "where" is interesting, marketing etc like the where

so then like looking at users, where they are from, and then other data (like page load times) is interesting, and interesting to ops

but of course things on the net != physical location, but routes/networks etc is interesting, so can look at pagetime per network for example, moar interesting.

you can then give better data back to the marketing and give it quickly, and really work with them, collecting all the good business metrics stuff, from your app/site


combining the useful data and making it real time


graphite <-- look at, recconnoiter <--- WANT!

sesonal data thing in rrd tool? look for paper, for holt planning?


everything real time
