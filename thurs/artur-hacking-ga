Artur Bergman - Hacking google analytics for tracking other data


showing all sorts of other traffic tracking stuff, with a bunch of data points

think he is serving out the ga from a cached varnish? missed the start :( guessing using a lot of different ga stuff from the pages


different data points, from like /osais/0/1 /osais/0/2 etc

Wikia varnish google analytics - they put GA calls into the vcl? Search for this online
