Yahoo IPv6 day:

* used ipv6 proxies
* 6to4 relays at peering points
* direct the user, help pages, give them tests and explain how to fix
* Test all for a dual stack
* remember the monitoring, it can behave different (things like service health checks too), check it from different views

Facebook - real interesting talk about scaling, need to get the slides as packed with info, a lot with open compute

They did a lot with software before moving to building their own hardware (hiphop etc).

Less is more when they designed the server. It was all in house. They use a tripple rack, as it saves time when shifting the large amounts of hardware

No frills servers, 1.5U. Again go reading the opencompute for infos

* make something work for you
* small teams win
* reboot on lan! (getting added in)
* take risks but have hedges for them
* itterate and innovate
