The NY web performance meetup group held a meetup.

Lots of chat about running your own meetup.

If vendors are sponsoring and doing presentations, then it has to be vendor neutral, people don't want a sales pitch.

Starting a new group - line up a few talks and publish the details. People see you are serious and there is content coming. Else it can be hard to get new talks ready on time.

Don't be afraid to experiment and don't be discouraged. People are pasionate and there to learn, share, interact :)

Get topics and vote on them, really good for juding the community/audience. Also pitch things broader to interest more people, you can then zoom in.
